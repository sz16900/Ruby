# Converting between integers and floats is easy -- just use to_i and to_f respectively:
puts 34.32.to_i
puts 43.to_f

# Because Ruby is so flexible, it lets you do some quirky things like multiplying 
# completely different data types together:
puts "seth " * 34

# Range:
3..11 # from 1 to 11 inclusive
3...11 # from 1 to 11 non-inclusive
 
# = set
# == equality 
# === equality (strict)
